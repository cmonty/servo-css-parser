That means: If three or four values are given, then each  or  represents an offset and must be preceded by a keyword, which specifies from which edge the offset is given. For example, `bottom 10px right 20px` represents a `10px` vertical offset up from the bottom edge and a `20px` horizontal offset leftward from the right edge. If three values are given, the missing offset is assumed to be zero. But for some historical reasons we need to keep CSS Level 2 syntax which only supports up to 2-value.
